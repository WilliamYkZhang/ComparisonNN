Comparing Three neural networks for Asset Price Prediction. Please view Results.pdf for more information.

# Abstract 
Financial asset pricing is one of the key driving forces in our economy, with various models such
as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), attempting to understand, explain and predict future asset
prices. However, due to its multi-factored nature, lack of linear representation and inherent noise in
financial pricing, it is impossible to determine all underlying factors that influence an asset price. In
order to solve these issues, machine learning techniques are used to establish relationships across
multiple factors and determine their effect on asset prices. The current state-of-the art models for
time series analysis are Multilayered Perceptrons (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). With the last two models able to map time dependencies in
order to more accurately represent various economic movements. While all three models are able to
accurately map non-linear relationships, they do so using differing techniques. The three techniques
are compared on their accuracy, their loss using mean squared error, and their performance in average
daily returns. Based on their results, it is found that RNNs are the overall best model for asset price
prediction.
